# PodcastPro v2 - Project Status

## Current Status: MVP Development & Testing Phase

**Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Status**: ðŸ”¥ **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - Final debugging phase  
**Progress**: 85% complete - Core systems working, final integration issues being resolved  

## Project Not Yet Complete - Still in Development

This project is **NOT COMPLETE** and is actively being developed. While significant progress has been made, we are currently in the final debugging phase to achieve a fully functional MVP.

## What's Working âœ…

### Core Systems (Production Ready)
- **Flask API Server**: Running stable on port 5000
- **Authentication System**: JWT login/registration fully functional
- **Database Architecture**: SQLite with synchronized models
- **Podcast Management**: Full CRUD operations working
- **Episode Management**: Basic CRUD operations working
- **Protected Endpoints**: Authorization working correctly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses
- **Git Backup**: Repository secured at github.com/tgdscott/pod2

### Test Results: 3/7 Tests Passing
- âœ… **User Registration/Login**: Complete auth flow working
- âœ… **Podcast Creation**: Handles duplicates, full CRUD
- âœ… **Episode Creation**: Basic episode management
- âœ… **Data Retrieval**: All endpoints returning data
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Proper validation and responses

## What's Being Debugged âš¡

### Critical Issues (2 remaining)
1. **File Upload System**
   - **Issue**: `'filename'` attribute error in UserFile model
   - **Impact**: Cannot upload audio files
   - **Fix**: Update model to use `original_filename` or `stored_filename`

2. **Episode Processing**
   - **Issue**: Background processing fails due to Celery configuration
   - **Impact**: Episodes created but not processed
   - **Fix**: Configure Celery task queue properly

## MVP Completion Criteria

### To Achieve 7/7 Tests Passing
- [ ] Fix file upload attribute error
- [ ] Configure Celery for background jobs
- [ ] Test audio file processing pipeline
- [ ] Validate end-to-end workflow

### MVP Features Required
- [x] User registration/login
- [x] Podcast creation and management
- [x] Episode creation and management
- [ ] File upload and storage
- [ ] Background episode processing
- [x] API security and validation
- [x] Error handling and logging

## Technical Achievements

### Architecture
- Clean, scalable Flask API design
- Proper database relationships and constraints
- JWT security implementation
- Consistent error handling patterns

### Code Quality
- Modular blueprint architecture
- Proper database session management
- Comprehensive logging
- Clean separation of concerns

### Testing
- Real-world end-to-end test suite
- Protected endpoint testing
- Authentication flow validation
- Integration testing framework

## Recent Development History

### Major Rebuild (July 17-18, 2025)
- **Lost 3 days of work** - Had to rebuild entire backend
- **Rebuilt from scratch**: All API endpoints, models, authentication
- **Established git backup**: Secured at github.com/tgdscott/pod2
- **Fixed critical issues**: Database sessions, field naming, imports

### Current Focus
- **File Upload**: Debugging UserFile model attribute issues
- **Background Processing**: Configuring Celery for episode processing
- **Integration Testing**: Achieving 7/7 test success rate

## Next Steps to Completion

### Immediate (Next 1-2 Days)
1. Fix file upload `filename` attribute error
2. Configure Celery Redis task queue
3. Test audio file processing pipeline
4. Achieve 7/7 real-world test success

### Short Term (Next Week)
1. Deploy to production environment
2. Implement audio processing features
3. Add advanced template system
4. Performance optimization

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Add AI features (transcription, show notes)
2. Implement advanced audio processing
3. Add web interface
4. Scale for multiple users

## Success Metrics
- **Current**: 3/7 tests passing (43% success rate)
- **Target**: 7/7 tests passing (100% success rate)
- **Blockers**: 2 critical issues remaining
- **ETA**: 1-2 days to MVP completion

## Project Will Be Complete When:
- [ ] All 7 real-world tests pass
- [ ] File upload system working
- [ ] Background processing functional
- [ ] Audio files can be processed end-to-end
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Documentation updated

## Current State: Not Production Ready
This project is **not yet ready for production use**. While core authentication and CRUD operations are working, the file upload and background processing systems need to be completed before this can be considered a functional MVP.

**Estimated Time to Completion**: 1-2 days of focused debugging and testing.
