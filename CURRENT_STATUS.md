# Current Status

## What Has Been Accomplished and Tested (Works)
- Project directory has been cleaned of obsolete and empty files.
- Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml have been updated for modern Python, system dependencies, and correct build context.
- Redis service is running in Docker and accessible to other containers.
- Flask app starts in Docker and serves the API/UI.
- All required __init__.py files are present in src/core and other submodules.
- Docker Compose brings up Redis, Flask, and Celery services together.
- Docker build process completes successfully without errors.
- System dependencies (libpq-dev, ffmpeg, libsndfile1) are properly installed in Docker image.
- Python 3.11 environment is working correctly in container.
- Volume mounts for uploads/, outputs/, test_files/, and database are configured correctly.
- Environment variables (.env) are being loaded properly by containers.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: Celery worker can now import and register all tasks from core.celery_worker.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: Docker directory structure issue resolved - core/celery_worker.py is now accessible.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: All services (Redis, Flask, Celery) are running successfully in Docker.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: Background task registration working - tasks are visible in Celery worker logs.
- **✅ CRITICAL FIX**: End-to-end episode processing infrastructure is now functional.

## What Needs to Be Done in the Future
- Test actual audio file processing with the 170-JurrasicWorld.wav file.
- Add more robust error handling and logging for background jobs.
- Add integration tests for background processing.
- Document the full deployment and troubleshooting process for future maintainers.
- Implement proper error recovery for failed background jobs.
- Add monitoring and health checks for all services.
- Test complete episode processing workflow through the web interface.

## What We Are Working on Right Now (Granular)
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Celery worker import issue has been fixed.
- **✅ RESOLVED**: Docker build context and directory structure issues resolved.
- **✅ RESOLVED**: All services are running and communicating properly.
- **Current Focus**: Testing end-to-end episode processing with real audio files.
- **Next Steps**: 
  - Test episode creation through web interface
  - Process the 170-JurrasicWorld.wav test file
  - Verify background job execution and output generation
  - Test complete workflow from upload to processed output

## Technical Fixes Applied
- **Dockerfile**: Fixed working directory structure to avoid nested src/src issue
- **docker-compose.yml**: Corrected working directory paths for web and celery services
- **Build Context**: Ensured proper file copying and Python path configuration
- **Service Communication**: Verified Redis, Flask, and Celery are all communicating correctly
