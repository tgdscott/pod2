## Current Session Focus
1. **Fix file upload `filename` attribute error**
2. **Configure Celery for background jobs**
3. **Achieve 7/7 test success rate**

## How to Test Right Now
```bash
# Start server
python run.py

# Run comprehensive test
python test_real_world.py

# Expected: 3/7 tests passing
```

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix UserFile model attribute issue
2. Configure Celery Redis for background jobs
3. Test audio file processing pipeline
4. Deploy to production

## Success Criteria
- [ ] 7/7 tests passing
- [ ] File upload working
- [ ] Background processing functional
- [ ] Audio files processing end-to-end

**ETA to MVP**: 1-2 days of focused debugging

## Key Files to Monitor
- `src/api/files.py` - File upload system
- `src/api/episodes.py` - Episode processing
- `src/database/models_dev.py` - Database models
- `test_real_world.py` - End-to-end testing

## Recent Achievements
- **Major Rebuild**: Rebuilt entire backend after losing 3 days of work
- **Database Sync**: Fixed model synchronization issues
- **Auth System**: Rock-solid JWT authentication
- **Git Backup**: Established secure backup system
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive real-world testing

This is an active development session focused on the final debugging phase before MVP completion.
