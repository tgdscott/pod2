# PodcastPro v2 - Universal Podcast Creation Platform

## Project Overview
**Date Started**: July 14, 2025  
**Current Date**: July 18, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 4 Complete âœ… - MVP Testing & Debugging Phase  
**Goal**: Create a scalable, user-friendly podcast automation platform  

## Current Status (July 18, 2025)
ðŸ”¥ **ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT** - End-to-end testing and debugging in progress  
- âœ… **Server Running**: Flask API operational on port 5000
- âœ… **Authentication**: User registration/login working (JWT)
- âœ… **Podcast Management**: Create/read/update/delete operations working
- âœ… **Episode Management**: Basic CRUD operations working
- âš¡ **File Upload**: Currently debugging file upload issues
- âš¡ **Episode Processing**: Background processing partially working
- âœ… **Database**: SQLite with synchronized models (models_dev.py)
- âœ… **Git Backup**: Repository backed up to github.com/tgdscott/pod2
- ðŸ“Š **Test Results**: 3/7 real-world tests passing

## Recent Fixes & Progress
- **Fixed**: Database session management in episode processing
- **Fixed**: Podcast creation duplicate title handling
- **Fixed**: Episode processing JSON content-type issue
- **Fixed**: Model field synchronization (title vs name)
- **Working**: Complete authentication flow
- **Working**: Podcast and episode CRUD operations
- **Working**: Protected endpoint authorization  

## Vision Statement
Transform podcast creation from a technical barrier into an intuitive, automated process. Users upload raw audio, configure their show template once, and get professional podcast episodes with minimal effort.

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Single Job Type**: Podcast Creation (not Audio Processing/Transcription)
- **Template System**: Flexible intro/outro/commercial/segment configuration
- **Audio Processing**: Filler word removal, silence reduction, normalization
- **Intelligence**: Keyword detection for commercial breaks and commands
- **Automation**: Show notes generation, metadata creation, publishing
- **Multi-tenant**: Built for thousands of users from day one

## Context for Future LLMs
This is a complete rebuild of a podcast automation tool. The original was Cinema IRL-specific; this version is generalized for any podcast format. All decisions and progress are documented in the `docs/` folder. The implementation plan is designed for rapid development while maintaining production quality.

**Key Principle**: Make podcast creation as easy as uploading a file and clicking "Process"
