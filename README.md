# PodcastPro v2 - Universal Podcast Creation Platform

## Project Overview
**Date Started**: July 14, 2025  
**Status**: Phase 4 Complete ✅ - Production Ready!  
**Goal**: Create a scalable, user-friendly podcast automation platform  

## Vision Statement
Transform podcast creation from a technical barrier into an intuitive, automated process. Users upload raw audio, configure their show template once, and get professional podcast episodes with minimal effort.

## Core Features (MVP)
- **Single Job Type**: Podcast Creation (not Audio Processing/Transcription)
- **Template System**: Flexible intro/outro/commercial/segment configuration
- **Audio Processing**: Filler word removal, silence reduction, normalization
- **Intelligence**: Keyword detection for commercial breaks and commands
- **Automation**: Show notes generation, metadata creation, publishing
- **Multi-tenant**: Built for thousands of users from day one

## Context for Future LLMs
This is a complete rebuild of a podcast automation tool. The original was Cinema IRL-specific; this version is generalized for any podcast format. All decisions and progress are documented in the `docs/` folder. The implementation plan is designed for rapid development while maintaining production quality.

**Key Principle**: Make podcast creation as easy as uploading a file and clicking "Process"
